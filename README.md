take-home project for devoted health implemented following TechAssignment.pdf requirements

# TODOS

- Add interface for Database
- Implement Database interface as InMemoryDatabase. First as psuedocode skeleton. Then method by method
- Setup prettier
- Setup eslint
- Setup ts-node to execute script
- Setup tsdoc https://typedoc.org/guides/doccomments/
- Setup mocha for testing. Consider testing both the CLI and the InMemoryDatabase.
- Use commander to to implement CLI interface for InMemoryDatabase
- Explain how to install node with n

- Consider implementing a main JS file with TSC build so this could be included as a library. `"main": "scripts/connectInMemory",`

# File Structure

- .yarnrc includes a single line that instructs the yarn package manager to install specific versions of libraries ensuring a consistent application across installs.

# Decisions

- Yarn instead of npm: TODO
- TypeScript instead of JavaScript: TODO
- Class instead of function: TODO
- Why git and source control in general?: TODO
- Why linter and code formatter?: TODO
